# Giospatial Data analysis project - Working 

# Visualizing traffic on the streets of Toronto
In this project, I aim to hone my skills with analyzing and visualizing geospatial data to tell a story


## ‚úÖ Purpose & Overview
The objective of this project is to:
- Develop an interactive plot to visualize giospatial data
- Identify significant traffic congestion areas in Toronto city.
- Provide intuitive visualizations to support model interpretability for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Dataset Overview 
The City of Toronto's Transportation Services Division collects short-term traffic count data across the City on an ad-hoc basis to support a variety of safety initiatives and projects....

| centreline_type   | Intersection node or Midblock segment.                                                              |
| centreline_id     | Unique location identifier that corresponds to the Toronto Centreline or Intersection File datasets.|
| start_time        | Start time of the 15-minute interval                                                                |

| px                | If there is a traffic control signal at the location, this is the unique identifier for the signal. |
| n_appr_cars_r     | Volume of cars that enter the intersection from the north leg (approach), in a southbound direction of travel, and make a right turn.|
| n_appr_cars_t     | Volume of cars that enter the intersection from the north leg (approach), in a southbound direction of travel, and continue through. |


## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

### Key trends and insights:
- **Age**: Normally distributed across the population.  
- **Sex Distribution**: Majority male, indicating gender imbalance.  
- **Chest Pain Type**: Most common is 'ASY' (Asymptomatic).  
- **Feature Correlation**: Oldpeak and ST_Slope show notable associations with heart disease.

## üß† Data Visualization

Developed Visualizations:
- Plotly Scatter map for basic geospatial visualization
- Matplotlib plots for ploting timeseries data 

## üé® Data Visualization Objectives

1. **Explore the distribution of street intersections in Toronto City**
    - Giospatial visualization

2. **Examine the average traffic across time**  
   - Timeseries plots

## üéØ Audience

This project is designed for:

- **Anyone interested in Toronto city traffic across days and time
